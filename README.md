# Pipeline for species identification

This repository contains the work done exploring, evaluating, and training models for species identification in underwater images. 
The main goal is to play with and learn about the open-sourced models and datasets provided by the [Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute](https://www.mbari.org/).

- [Exploring MBARI Bethic Object Detector](mbari_bethic_object_detector.ipynb): This notebook explores the MBARI Bethic Object Detector, a YOLOv5 model trained to detect and classify species and objects in the Bethic zone, along the ocean flora. The notebook also dabbles with the idea of applying an image-upscaler to increase model performance on an external dataset, without any extra training or fine-tuning.
