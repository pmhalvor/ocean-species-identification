    "## Background\n",
    "- Object detection vs. object tracking\n",
    "    - Detections can vary from frame to frame due to blur, pose, occlusion, etc.\n",
    "    - One object may recieve many tracked ids if a detection is not produced in a (set of) frame(s)\n",
    "    - Tracking requires then both detections but also a way to associate them across frames\n",
    "    - Tracking can be online or offline, depending on the computational resources available\n",
    "    - Modern tracking techniques typically use a detector (YOLO, ResNet, etc.) together with a tracker (SORT, ByteTrack, etc.)\n",
    "- Movement predictions require info about velocity, direction, etc.\n",
    "    - Can be constant, determined beforehand or learned from data\n",
    "    - Can be adaptive, as seen in Kalman filters \n",
    "- Some classic methods exploit derivative-like estimatations of postion from changes in detections between frames\n",
    "    - Even simplier ones just look at IOU between objects found through filtering\n",
    "- Some trackers that leverage deep learning incorporate visual information about each detected object to help performance\n",
    "    - This can be done through embeddings, which are learned representations of the object's appearance\n",
    "    - These embeddings can be used to associate objects across frames, even when they are occluded or change appearance\n",
    "- Evaluating trackers is a difficult task, as there is no single metric that can capture all the nuances of tracking performance\n",
    "    - MOTA, MOTP, etc. are some of the most popular metrics used to evaluate trackers\n",
    "    - These metrics are based on the number of false positives, false negatives, and identity switches that occur during tracking\n",
    "    - The MOTChallenge is a popular benchmark for evaluating multiple object tracking algorithms\n"
