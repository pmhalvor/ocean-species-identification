    "In this note, we want to explore the basics of containerization with Docker.\n",
    "To start the note off, some background terminology needed to understand these technologies is covered, basically summarizing the [Docker overview](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/). \n",
    "From here, we introduce a small example project and go through the necessary steps to build custom images suited specifically to the needs of the project.\n",
    "Iterating on these simpler images, we then wrap a simplified machine learning model with a GUI into a container and show how to run and interact with this locally. \n",
    "The note rounds off with some tips on how such a model would be deployed to a server. \n",

    "## Problem\n",
    "In software development, it is often necessary to run code on different machines, with different operating systems, and with different dependency versions.\n",
    "The underlying code is the same, but the environment in which it runs can vary significantly.\n",
    "Some may argue that well-written code should be executable on any machine, but in reality, things are not always that simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, systems require specific drivers, modules, or libraries to run, or the code is written in a language that is not natively supported by the target machine.\n",
    "[OS-level virtualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating-system-level_virtualization) makes it possible to run multiple (even nested) operating systems on a single physical machine, providing the essential first steps towards solving the problem of cross-platform collaboration. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, even with virtual machines, the code still needs to be packaged and shipped with all its dependencies.\n",
    "Dependency management within these systems can be a hassle, especially as outdated libraries become vulnerable to security threats, or as new versions of libraries break compatibility with existing code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many Python projects nowadays make use of package managers like [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) or [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) together with a `requirements.txt` file to manage and specify the exact versions of needed dependencies. \n",
    "Similar set-ups exist for other languages too, like [maven](https://maven.apache.org/) for Java/Scala or [cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/) for Rust, but these are not always enough to ensure that the code runs as expected on all machines.\n",
    "Even with these package managers, the target machine would still need to have the correct version of the language runtime installed, which introduces another potential source of conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transitioning from technical, project development to high-level, product management, the necessity for code to run the same way on different machines becomes even more critical.\n",
    "Whether the product needs to be deployed to a server with a different OS than the development team's local machines or the product is to be handed over as an executable program to a client, the code should always run as expected, without any issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, what if I told you there exists a tool that can solve all these problems and more? \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution\n",
    "To solve this problem, we need a way to package code and its dependencies into a single, self-contained unit that can be run anywhere.\n",
    "This is where containerization comes in.\n",
    "\n",
    "An application can be packaged into a container, which is a portable environment that contains everything needed to properly execute the application.\n",
    "This includes the code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings.\n",
    "Since containers are isolated environments, they can run on any machine that supports containerization technology, without compatibility issues or dependencies.\n",

    "\n",
    "Released in 2013, [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is an open-source platform that enables developers to build, ship, and run applications inside containers.\n",
    "It is the most popular containerization technology on the market, and it can be used to serve, share, and manage a range of applications, from simple scripts to complex microservices architectures.\n",
    "To understand how Docker works, it is necessary to learn the terminology describing [Docker objects](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/#docker-objects).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Essential**\n",
    "(Need to know)\n",
    "\n",
    "An **_image_** is a read-only template that contains the application code, runtime, libraries, and dependencies. Think of this as the filesystem snapshot, describing how the inside of the container should look.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **_container_** is a running instance of an image, with its own filesystem, network, and process space. It can serve or execute whatever task the image was built for. Containers are isolated from each other and the host machine, making them secure and portable, though they can be configured to communicate with each other and the host machine through networks and volumes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **_Dockerfile_** is a text file that contains instructions for building a Docker image. Each line represents a \"layer\" in the image and is a step in the process of building the final image. Arguments here are typically commands that would be run in a terminal to set up the environment for the application: defining environment variables, installs, cloning repositories, et cetera.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **_build_** is the process of creating a Docker image from a Dockerfile. This involves downloading the necessary files, installing dependencies, and configuring the image according to the instructions in the Dockerfile.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **_host machine_** is the machine on which Docker is installed and running. This is where the Docker daemon is running, managing containers, images, networks, and volumes.\n",
    "If you are following along and running the example commands in this note, your local machine is considered the host machine.\n",
    "\n",

    "<div style=\"text-align:center;\">Source: <i>Understand Dockerfile by Rocky Chen (<a href=\"https://medium.com/swlh/understand-dockerfile-dd11746ed183\">Medium</a>)</i></div>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Additional**\n",
    "(Good to know)\n",
    "\n",
    "A **registry** is a library of different Docker images, such as [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/), where public images are stored and shared. Docker Hub is the default registry for Docker images, and it is where you can find official images for many popular software packages, like databases, web servers, and programming languages. Private companies may maintain private registries, where internal images are managed and stored for proprietary or security reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **repository** is a collection of related Docker images (likely from the same project), tagged with version numbers. As updates are made to the project, new images including the updates are built and released under new version tags. This helps to keep track of changes and maintain a history of the project, in addition to dependency management. \n",
    "\n",
    "A **volume** is a persistent data storage mechanism for containers. Since containers are stateless (i.e. any data generated when running the container is deleted on container exit), volumes provide a way to store and share data between containers and the host machine. This is useful for storing configuration files, logs, or databases that need to persist across container restarts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Networks** are communication channels between containers. Different network types can be created to allow containers to communicate with each other, with the host machine, or with the rest of the internet. This is useful for creating microservices architectures, where different containers handle different parts of an application and need to communicate with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Architecture \n",
    "Docker containers are similar to virtual machines, but they are more lightweight and faster to start.\n",
    "They share the host operating system's kernel and run as a nested process, isolated from other containers and the host system, making them more efficient than full virtual machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the Docker client (`docker`), containers can be easily built, run, shared, and deleted, making them ideal for development, testing, and deployment.\n",
    "This CLI is the fastest way to interact with Docker, but there are also GUIs available, like [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop), which provides a graphical interface for managing containers, images, networks, and volumes.\n",
    "Docker Desktop is usually bundled with the Docker engine, which is the underlying software that runs and manages containers on the host machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Docker client communicates with the Docker daemon (`dockerd`), which is responsible for managing containers, images, networks, and volumes on the host machine.\n",
    "The daemon listens for API requests and manages the container lifecycle, including starting, stopping, and deleting containers, as well as building, pushing, and pulling images.\n",
    "\n",

    "<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><i>For more on its architecture see the <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/#docker-architecture\">Docker overview</a>.</i></div>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Local requirements\n",
    "To get started with Docker, you need to have [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed on your local machine.\n",
    "The tool is free for teams under 250 or less than $10 million in annual revenue, and it is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the Docker Desktop, it could be useful to have a [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) account.\n",
    "This is a cloud-based registry where you can store and share Docker images, either publicly or privately.\n",
    "It is also a place to find official images for popular software packages, as well as community-contributed images for a wide range of applications.\n",
    "If you only plan on using others' images, then you don't need an account. \n",
    "However, if you are going to want to push your own images to the registry, making them openly available to others, then you will need an account.\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- Local login? -->\n",
    "If you've downloaded Docker Desktop, you should be able to run the `docker` command in your terminal.\n",
    "You can easily log in to your Docker Hub account by running `docker login` and entering your credentials.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ docker login\n",
    "\n",
    "Login with your Docker ID to push and pull images from Docker Hub. If you don't have a Docker ID, head over to https://hub.docker.com to create one.\n",
    "Username: your-docker-id\n",
    "Password: **************\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will allow you to push and pull images from the registry, as well as manage your account settings.\n",
    "Alternatively, you can log in through the Docker Desktop GUI.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../img/DockerDesktop.png\" width=\"500\" style=\"display: block; margin: 0 auto;\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic commands \n",
    "\n",
    "### Browsing images\n",
    "\n",
    "To see what images are available on your local machine, you can run the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ docker images\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will list all the images that have been downloaded or built on your machine.\n",
    "If you've just downloaded Docker Desktop, you probably won't have any images yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's head over to the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) and find an image to download.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pulling and pushing images\n",
    "<!-- Download pytorch image -->\n",
    "Since we have been working with Python 3.11 for other parts of this series, let's pull an official Python image from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/python). \n",
    "For easy compatibility, we will pull the `bullseye` tag, which is based on Debian 11. \n",
    "If we were looking for a smaller image, we could have chosen the `slim` tag, which is based on Debian 11 slim, or better yet the `alpine` tag, which is typically used for lightweight images.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ docker pull python:3.11-bullseye\n",
    "\n",
    "3.11.9-bullseye: Pulling from library/python\n",

    "But this image is just a Python environment, not an application.\n",
    "There's no program in it yet, just an empty filesystem with Python installed.\n",
    "We can run this image as a container, and see what happens.\n",

    "That's because we didn't tell the container to do anything.\n",
    "Let's try running Python instead.\n",
    "To start, we'll just check the version. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Great, but does this mean we can run a local Python script using the container?\n",
    "Let's create a local Python file and test it out. \n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ echo \"greet = lambda x,n: print(x*n); greet('hello world ', 1)\" > greet.py\n",
    "$ docker run python:3.11.9-bullseye python greet.py\n",
    "\n",
    "python: can't open file '//greet.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory\n",
    "```\n",
    "This won't work because the container doesn't have access to the local filesystem, hence the _isolated environments_ mentioned earlier.\n",
    "The container can only see inside its own filesystem, by default, but can be given access to the host filesystem using volumes. \n",
    "More on that later. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's instead stick to the basics, and try to start a Python shell inside the container.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "$ docker run --rm -it python:3.11.9-bullseye python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python 3.11.9 (main, Apr 10 2024, 11:55:03) [GCC 10.2.1 20210110] on linux\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can see the internal files of the container.\n",
    "If we are using another Linux-based image, maybe one without a Python installation, we could also just start a bash shell inside the container. \n",
    "This gives us the ability to check what is installed in the container, and potentially install new packages. \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ docker run --rm -it debian:bullseye bash\n",
    "\n",
    "root@f5cz1337a85e:/# ls\n",
    "\n",
    "bin  boot  dev\tetc  home  lib\tmedia  mnt  opt  proc  root  run  sbin\tsrv  sys  tmp  usr  var\n",

    "In our container, we can see that Python is installed, along with `git`, `curl`, `apt-get`, and other basic utilities that come with a Debian distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Build custom images\n",
    "So, the question then is, how can we then run a container with our own code inside? \n",
    "This is where the `Dockerfile` comes in.\n",
    "\n",

    "Dockerfiles are text files that contain a series of instructions for building a Docker image.\n",
    "They typically start with a `FROM` instruction, which specifies the base image to build upon.\n",
    "This can be an official image from Docker Hub, like `python:3.11.9-bullseye`, or a custom image that you've built yourself.\n",
    "There are no limits to how many instructions you can include in a Dockerfile, but it is recommended to keep them as minimal as possible to reduce the image size and build time.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's typically a good idea to start with a base image that already has the necessary tools and libraries installed, and then add your own code and dependencies on top of that.\n",
    "If your team typically uses the same preprocessing steps or other common tasks, you could also consider creating a base image that includes these steps, and then build your application on top of that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of a simple Dockerfile that builds an image with Python 3.11.9 installed and our Python script `greet.py` made earlier, that prints \"hello world\" a few times.\n",
    "\n",
    "```Dockerfile\n",
    "# Use the official Python image as a parent image\n",

    "\n",
    "# Copy our file into the container at /app\n",
    "COPY greet.py /app\n",
    "\n",
    "# Run greet.py when the container launches\n",
    "CMD [\"python\", \"greet.py\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To build the image, we can run the following command in the same directory as the `Dockerfile` and `greet.py` file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ docker build -t greet-app:1 .\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will create a new image called `greet-app` based on the instructions in the `Dockerfile`.\n",
    "The image is currently only available on your local machine, but you can push it to Docker Hub or another registry to make it available to others.\n",
    "Before we do that though, let's check it runs as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ docker run greet-app:1\n",
    "\n",
    "hello world \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Sweet!\n",
    "We can now start seeing the power of Docker, as we can run this container on any machine that has Docker installed, and it will run the same way every time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now increase the complexity a bit more, by adding a Python script that takes in arguments. \n",
    "We can make some adjustments to our `greet.py` file from earlier, and call the new file `greet2.py`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "In this note, we covered the basics of Docker, including how **containers** are running instances of **images**, and how to build and run customized images and containers.\n",
    "We looked into data management and storage methods using mounted volumes.\n",
    "On top of these Docker fundamentals, we explored how to create and serve a simple Gradio app from within a container.\n",
    "\n",
    "We expanded on the simple examples typical in most tutorials by creating a Docker image that runs our own Python script that converts a series of images into a video.\n",
    "`img2vid.py` was a novel Python script written for another project but showcased how Docker helps solve the problem of running code with dependencies on different machines, as with `opencv` and its system-specific requirements.\n",
    "The ability to upload and download files through a **Gradio** app was a nice touch, paving the way for more complex containerized ML applications, like object detection or tracking models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through containerization, apps are made more accessible to users who don't have (or want) the necessary dependencies installed on their local machines, without any loss of functionality.\n",
    "By pushing the Docker images to a registry like Docker Hub, anyone can pull the images and run the applications on their local machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps \n",
    "* Connect a container to a server, accessible from the internet. \n",
    "* Create a more complex Gradio app that uses a pre-trained object detection model to track objects in a video.\n",
    "* Create an SR-MOT pipeline that can be run via a Gradio app from a Docker container. \n"
